- **[From single-sequences to evolutionary trajectories: protein language models capture the evolutionary potential of SARS-CoV-2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41714330/)**  
  Kieran D Lamb, Joseph Hughes, Spyros Lytras, Francesca Young, Orges Koci, James C Herzig · Nature communications · 2026-02-19  
  _PI score:_ `3.686`  
  _Protein language models (PLMs) capture features of protein three-dimensional structure from amino acid sequences alone, without requiring multiple sequence alignments (MSA). The concepts of grammar and semantics from natural language have been suggested to hav…_
